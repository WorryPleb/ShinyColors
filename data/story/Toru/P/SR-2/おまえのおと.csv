2020007010010,透,"ねぇ
これ","Hey,
about this."
2020007010020,透,こいつ,This.
2020007010030,透,"……これ
こいつ","...This.
This one."
2020007010040,透,生きてる？,Is it alive?
2020007010050,透,"────何
捨てるの、これ",────You're throwing this away?
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……え？
あぁ……","...Eh?
Ahh...
"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"そうじゃないか、
ごみのステッカー貼ってあるし","I thought so.
Since it has a “trash this” label on it and all."
2020007010060,透,えー,Eeeh.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"ずっと埋もれてたやつだよ、このギター
棚の奥にさ","It's been here for quite a while.
Hidden behind the shelves."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"これ……
セミだな","This...
It's a cicada, isn't it."
2020007010070,透,……白い。めっちゃ,It's really...white.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"うん。まだ殻から出てきたばっかりなんじゃないか
羽根も伸びてないし","Yeah. Looks like it's just emerged out of its shell.
It isn't spreading out its wings at all too."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"もうちゃんと音出ないんじゃないかな
弦とかも錆びてるし、首も反ってるし","I don't think it can be played anymore.
The strings are rusty and its neck is warped too."
2020007010080,透,"んー
古い。めっちゃ","Mn.
It's really... old."
2020007010090,透,鳴るかな────,I wonder if it'll make a sound────
0000000000000,プロデューサー,────あっ、触るのか！,"────Ah, you're gonna touch it?!"
2020007010100,透,"えっ
ダメ？","Eh?
I can't?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"いや……
わからないけど、まだ弱そうだからさ","No... I don't know. 
Just that it's still weak and all."
2020007010110,透,あー……,Ahh...
2020007010120,透,"うん
つきそう。指紋","Yeah.
Seems like they'll stick. My fingerprints."
2020007010130,透,"柔らかそう、めっちゃ
羽根とか……お腹とか","It looks really soft.
Its wings...and abdomen."
2020007010140,透,────鳴った,────It made a sound.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"はは
まぁ、鳴ることは鳴るだろうけど","Haha.
Well, I'm sure it can make a sound but,"
2020007010150,透,でも、ごみ？,"But, it's still trash?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"──たぶん、まだしっかりした体じゃないよ
飛べるようになるまではこのままだ","──It's probably not fully developed yet.
It'll stay like this until it can spread its wings 
and take flight."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"鳥とかにも狙われるんだろうし、
安全なとこに置いてあげたい気はするけど……","It'll make easy prey for birds and stuff.
I feel like we should leave it somewhere safe..."
2020007010160,透,"……
そっか","...
I see.
"
2020007010170,透,生きられないかもなんだ,So there's a chance it might not live.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"まぁ……
ごみって言い方するのは、気が引けるよ","Well...
Calling it “trash” might have been a little harsh."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,楽器なんだもんな,It's still a musical instrument.
2020007010180,透,"……
……えい","...
...here goes.
"
2020007010190,透,"……
動かないね","...
It's not moving."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,うん,Right.
2020007010200,透,鳴かないし,Not making any sound either.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……
弦、張り直してみるか？","...
Wanna re-adjust the strings?"
2020007010210,透,え？,Eh?
0000000000000,プロデューサー,これ、捨てるのやめてさ,I've decided to keep it.
2020007010220,透,"あー……
……────","Ah...
...────
"
2020007010230,透,"ふふ
セミかな、鳴かなくても","Fufu.
I wonder if it's still a cicada, 
even if it doesn't make a sound."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……え？,...Eh?
2020007010240,透,"こいつだけじゃん
黙ってるの","It's the only one here.
That's silent."
2020007010250,透,……いいや,...It's fine.
2020007010260,透,"鳴り終わったんでしょ、きっと
もう","I'm sure it's just, gotten tired of making noise. It's done now."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"……
黙っててもセミはセミだけど……","...
Pretty sure even a silent cicada is still a cicada..."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,鳴くやつになろうとしてる,It's trying to be like the others.
2020007010270,透,……ふーん,...Hmm.
2020007010280,透,"きれいなのにね
めっちゃ、今",Even though it looks so pretty now.
2020007010290,透,"鳴けなくて、
飛べないけど","Even if it can't make a sound,
or spread its wings."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……,...
0000000000000,プロデューサー,寿命かもしれないな,"Perhaps, it's lived its due."
2020007010300,透,"んー
でも、きれい。鳴らないやつ","Yeah.
Even if it doesn't make sound now, it's still beautiful."
2020007010310,透,"鳴ってた時が、
あるって思うと","Because you can think about how there was 
a time when it could."
2020007010320,透,"ギター、って呼ぼ
こいつのこと",I think I'll name it “Guitar”.
0000000000000,プロデューサー,……透,...Toru.
select,,"……
いい名前だな","...
That's a nice name"
select,,"また会えるかは
わからないけど","We don't know 
if we'll ever see it again"
select,,"音楽になるのか
鳴き声","Will its cries 
turn into music?"
0000000000000,プロデューサー,"きっと、いっぱい鳴ってくれるよ
無事に生きてさ","I'm sure it'll make a whole lot of noise.
And live a normal life."
2020007010330,透,んー……,Hmm...
2020007010340,透,"ふふっ
ううん","Fufu.
I doubt it."
2020007010350,透,"似てるから、
あの鳴らないやつと","It's too much like that old, silent thing."
2020007010360,透,"続いてたらいいなって。ここに
あのギターの時間","I'd like it if the life of that guitar could continue, 
right here. 
Through this cicada."
2020007010370,透,聴こえる,I can still hear it.
2020007010380,透,"……え、うん
だから","...Eh? Yeah.
That's why."
2020007010390,透,"覚えとくために
こいつのこと","I want to name it, so I'll always remember it."
2020007010400,透,"鳴いても、
このまま鳴かないで終わっても","Whether it starts to make sound one day,
or stays quiet the whole way."
2020007010410,透,いつか鳴けなくなっても,Or if it sings till it becomes unable to.
2020007010420,透,きれいな音出してたってこと,"I'll make sure to always remember that 
it once made a beautiful sound."
2020007010430,透,"ふふっ
何、かっこいい","Fufu.
What's with that? Sounds cool."
0000000000000,プロデューサー,いや────,Nah────
2020007010440,透,"なるんじゃない？
音楽になりたいって思えば、こいつが","Maybe it will, though?
If it wanted to make music, I bet it could."
2020007010450,透,たぶん、ギターも,I'm sure it's the same for that guitar.
2020007010460,透,"次、なりたいって思ったらなれる
セミに","If it wished hard enough for it, 
it could become one in it's next life.
A cicada."
2020007010470,透,"……ね
久しぶり、ギター","...Right?
It's been awhile, guitar."
