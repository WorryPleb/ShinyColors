## WARNING!!!
This type of tool that modifies game files is not allowed per the game Terms of Service.  Please use at your own risk!!!  We are not responsible for any actions taken towards your account if you use this translation tool.
## WARNING!!!

## Updates
Once you have the patch set up, it will grab future updates automatically.  The only exception to this is if there is a change in the Shiny Colors game code, at which point tampermonkey should detect there is a new script to download.  If tampermonkey doesn't automatically detect it, you should still get an @everyone ping in the discord prompting you to re-download the script from the links below.

## Installing on Desktop
1. It's recommended to run this patch on Chrome
2. First install the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) extension
3. After installing the extension，download the script: https://github.com/snowyivu/ShinyColors/raw/gh-pages/ShinyColors.user.js ，tampermonkey should prompt you to load it
4. Finally, [(Click Here)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E9%97%AA%E8%80%80%E8%89%B2%E5%BD%A9%E5%BC%82%E6%AD%A5%E8%84%9A%E6%9C%AC/caafhkjcgpbinkgnghkojaoipgdkbcbc/) to install the new ShinyColors script syncing extension, which will prevent an issue where the patch would fall off during season changes, etc.
5. Refresh game page and the patch should work automatically
(If you have played before, you may need to clear your browser's cache and cookies to remove existing Japanese files)
